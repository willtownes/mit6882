\section{Instructions} %comment out this section before turning in!
The proposal (one per team) will be a written pdf document, 1-2 pages long, outlining the work to be done. It should include a plan with at least 4 steps, and indicate your internal deadlines for each of those steps. If there are multiple participants, the division of responsibility should be made clear. In addition, please include your assessment of what the “risks” to the project are: that is, what things do you think might turn out to be more difficult than planned, and what thoughts do you have about how to mitigate the risks?
If you are going to do an empirical study, be sure that you think about how you will evaluate your method—ideally in comparison to other methods.
Remember that almost anything will turn out to be harder and more time-consuming than you expect. Try to arrange your project so that there are intermediate milestones that can serve as alternative finishing points, in case you don’t get to the end. It will be much better to turn in a polished version of a small-scale project than to find yourself at the end of the term with a three-quarters implemented system of great depth and scope.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
\item code and visualize a dirichlet process sampler. Visualization maybe via a simple 2-D clustering simulation.
\item code and visualize a``sticky'' hierarchical dirichlet process sampler. Visualization via a simple 2-D clusters-within clusters simulation.
\item Write a sampler for a (non-switching) linear dynamical system, test with simulation.
\item Write sampler with hidden markov model with fixed number of modes
\item combine it all together, switching linear dynamical system with sticky HDP prior, with the conjugate priors.
\item same as previous but with automatic relevance determination (ARD) priors. I think that is the full model of Fox's paper.
\item (optional)- apply to Dr. Lehman's data and see if we get similar mode identification that she had.
\item (optional)- apply firefly MCMC method if possible
\end{enumerate}
